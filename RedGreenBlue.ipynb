    "For this project, I wanted to blend different genres/styles of poetry together, similar to how colors can be mixed. I picked three emotions: melancholic, lust, and peaceful, and assigned them corresponding colors of blue, red, and green. I wanted to choose a selection of different poems written by different authors that encapsulated each emotion, and use Tracery to output text containing words from those selections. For my melancholic 'blue' text, I chose \"The City in the Sea\" by Edgar Allan Poe, and \"Ode on Melancholy\" by John Keats, both of which were quite sorrowful. For my 'red' text, I chose \"Dream-Land\" and \"Romance\", both of which were written by Edgar Allan Poe (I'm not too well versed in poetry, and Poe was one of the only few poets I was familiar with). For my 'green' text, I chose \"Easter Morning\" by AR Ammons, a very visual depiction of the relationship between nature and the inner self."
